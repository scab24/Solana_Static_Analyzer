# Medium Issues

## M-1: Duplicate Mutable Accounts in 'VulnerableDuplicateMutable'

Detects when an Anchor instruction has multiple mutable accounts that could reference the same account

<details><summary>1 Found Instance</summary>

- Found in lib.rs [Line: 58]

	```rust
	#[derive(Accounts)]
	pub struct VulnerableDuplicateMutable<'info> {
	    /// CHECK: This account is vulnerable to duplicate account attacks
	    #[account(mut)]
	    pub account1: AccountInfo<'info>,
	    
	    /// CHECK: This account is vulnerable to duplicate account attacks
	    #[account(mut)]
	    pub account2: AccountInfo<'info>,
	    
	    pub authority: Signer<'info>,
	}
	```

	```rust
	pub fn vulnerable_division(ctx: Context<Initialize>, divisor: u64) -> Result<()> {
	        //TODO
	        let a = 100;
	        let _result = a / divisor;
	        
	        Ok(())

<details><summary>1 Found Instance</summary>

- Found in lib.rs [Line: 93]

	```rust
	#[derive(Accounts)]
	pub struct TransferFunds<'info> {
	    /// CHECK: The source account != destination account
	    #[account(
	        mut,
	        owner = system_program::ID,
	        constraint = source.key() != destination.key() @ ErrorCode::SameAccount
	    )]
	    pub source: AccountInfo<'info>,
	    
	    /// CHECK: The destination account is verified by the owner constraint
	    #[account(
	        mut,
	        owner = system_program::ID
	    )]
	    pub destination: AccountInfo<'info>,
	    
	    pub authority: Signer<'info>,
	    
	    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,

# Low Issues

## L-1: Anchor Instructions Detection in 'transfer_funds'

Detects functions that are Anchor program instructions (public functions with Context parameter)

<details><summary>1 Found Instance</summary>

- Found in lib.rs [Line: 23]

	```rust
	pub fn transfer_funds(ctx: Context<TransferFunds>, amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
	        if **ctx.accounts.source.lamports.borrow() < amount {
	            return Err(error!(ErrorCode::InsufficientFunds));
	        }
	        
	        **ctx.accounts.source.lamports.borrow_mut() -= amount;
	        **ctx.accounts.destination.lamports.borrow_mut() += amount;
	        
	        let x = 200;
	        let y = 2;
	        let _result = x / y; 
	        
	        Ok(())
	    }
	```

</details>



## L-2: Missing Error Handling in Public Functions in 'validate_account_name'

Detects public functions that don't return Result<T> and may fail silently. In Solana contracts, proper error handling is essential for security and debugging.

<details><summary>1 Found Instance</summary>

- Found in lib.rs [Line: 85]

	```rust
	pub fn validate_account_name(name: String) {
	    // This function performs validation but doesn't return Result
	    if name.len() > 32 {
	        panic!("Name too long");  // Bad error handling
	    }
	    println!("Account name is valid: {}", name);
	}
	```

</details>



## L-3: Missing Error Handling in Public Functions in 'calculate_fee'

Detects public functions that don't return Result<T> and may fail silently. In Solana contracts, proper error handling is essential for security and debugging.

<details><summary>1 Found Instance</summary>

- Found in lib.rs [Line: 79]

	```rust
	pub fn calculate_fee(amount: u64) -> u64 {
	    // This function could fail but doesn't return Result
	    amount * 5 / 100  // Could panic on overflow
	}
	```

</details>



## L-4: Anchor Instructions Detection in 'initialize'

Detects functions that are Anchor program instructions (public functions with Context parameter)

<details><summary>1 Found Instance</summary>

- Found in lib.rs [Line: 18]

	```rust
	pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
	        msg!("Greetings from: {:?}", ctx.program_id);
	        Ok(())
	    }
	```

</details>



## L-5: Anchor Instructions Detection in 'vulnerable_division'

Detects functions that are Anchor program instructions (public functions with Context parameter)

<details><summary>1 Found Instance</summary>

- Found in lib.rs [Line: 38]

	```rust
	pub fn vulnerable_division(ctx: Context<Initialize>, divisor: u64) -> Result<()> {
	        //TODO
	        let a = 100;
	        let _result = a / divisor;
	        
	        Ok(())
	    }
	```

</details>



## L-6: Anchor Instructions Detection in 'vulnerable_withdraw'

Detects functions that are Anchor program instructions (public functions with Context parameter)

<details><summary>1 Found Instance</summary>

- Found in lib.rs [Line: 47]

	```rust
	pub fn vulnerable_withdraw(ctx: Context<SimpleVulnerable>, amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
	        // This function transfers funds but doesn't verify who's calling it!
	        **ctx.accounts.account.lamports.borrow_mut() -= amount;
	        
	        Ok(())
	    }
	```

Detects functions that are Anchor program instructions (public functions with Context parameter)

<details><summary>1 Found Instance</summary>

- Found in lib.rs [Line: 71]

	```rust
	pub fn vulnerable_duplicate_accounts(ctx: Context<VulnerableDuplicateMutable>) -> Result<()> {
	    **ctx.accounts.account1.lamports.borrow_mut() -= 100;
